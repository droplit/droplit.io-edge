## Notes
--------

### Changing Mode to Auto ###

* If changing the mode to `AUTO`, the temperatures must be set beforehand to accomodate for the set delta point, the difference between the set cool and heat temperatures of the thermostat.
* When mode is set to `AUTO`, the set cool temperature must be greater than the heat temperature by at least the set delta point which by default is set to `2`.

### Changing Set Cool/Heat Temperatures

* If changing the desired set cool/heat temperature, the thermostat must be in a mode that uses the relevant setting. For example, setting the cool temperature requires the thermostat to be in either `COOL` or `AUTO` mode.
